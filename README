STATUS: This package is completely useless.

** BUILDING **
- you need c-ares, only 1.7.4 has been tested so far

- you should have ExtUtils::PkgConfig installed, it should pick all the
  libcurl options needed to build this module
  * if the above isn't working for you, you can edit Makefile.PL,
    there is a %ares hash on the top of the file, which should be filled
    with correct value

- have in mind that tests depend on network availability and may not cover
  all the quirks found in your operating system, some of them even depend on
  proper timing, so sometimes they could fail without an apparent reason
  (in case of very slow network connection or very heavily loaded system)


** TODO **

- everything
